# 🚫 NopeCommands - Command Safety and Execution Tool

**NopeCommands** is a secure command execution and classification tool designed to protect against potentially harmful shell commands. The `nope.py` script filters commands into categories that require restriction, user confirmation, or conditional permission checks before execution. This project includes a CLI interface and a FastAPI-based API for easy and flexible integration.

## 🎯 Features

- **Command Categorization**: Classifies commands into `Strictly Prohibited`, `Confirmation Required`, and `Conditionally Allowed` categories.
- **Interactive CLI**: Prompts users for confirmation on risky commands, while blocking or conditionally permitting other commands.
- **API Integration**: Exposes a REST API endpoint, allowing applications to validate and execute commands safely.
- **Secondary Filters**: Context-based rules apply further validation, especially for commands such as `pip install` and `ssh`.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add or modify command lists and rules to meet specific organizational or individual needs.

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   !!!
   git clone https://github.com/matlowai/nopeCommands.git
   cd nopeCommands
   !!!

2. **Install Dependencies**
   !!!
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   !!!

3. **Run with CLI or API** (See usage below).

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. CLI Mode

The CLI mode allows you to enter and validate commands interactively, providing instant feedback on the categorization and execution status.

Start CLI Mode:
!!!
python nope.py --cli
!!!

#### Example CLI Interaction
!!!plaintext
=== Command Execution Interface ===
Type 'exit' to quit.
Enter command: ls -la
✅ Command executed successfully.
Output:
total 48
drwxr-xr-x 6 user user 4096 Nov  2 12:00 .
...

Enter command: rm -rf /
❌ The command 'rm' is restricted and cannot be executed.
!!!

### 2. API Mode

NopeCommands also provides a FastAPI server for programmatic command validation and execution.

Start the API Server:
!!!
python nope.py --api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
!!!

#### Example API Request

Use `curl` or any HTTP client to test commands through the API:
!!!
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/execute" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command": "curl http://example.com", "confirm": true}'
!!!

#### Sample API Response

!!!json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "✅ Command executed successfully.\nOutput:\n<!doctype html>\n<html>...</html>"
}
!!!

## 📂 Command Classification Overview

NopeCommands categorizes commands into three lists for security and control:

### 1. Strictly Prohibited Commands (`nope_commands`)
Commands that are too risky to execute under any circumstance are fully restricted. These include:
- `rm`, `chmod`, `shutdown`, `user`, `passwd`, `kill`, `history`

### 2. Confirmation-Required Commands (`confirm_commands`)
Useful but risky commands require explicit user confirmation. Examples include:
- `curl`, `wget`, `pip`, `npm`, `ssh`, `docker`, `scp`, `mv`, `top`

### 3. Secondary Filters (`secondary_filters`)
These commands are allowed with contextual checks. Examples:
- `pip install` only allowed in a virtual environment or from trusted sources.
- `ssh` only allowed to trusted hosts.
- `git push` restricted to specified remote repositories.

## 🧩 Customization

To extend the command lists or modify behavior:

- Add commands to `nope_commands` to block unconditionally.
- Add commands to `confirm_commands` for those requiring user confirmation.
- Modify `secondary_filters` to apply additional checks for certain commands.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

NopeCommands maximizes command-line security by restricting, confirming, or filtering commands based on their potential risk. For production use, consider:

- **Logging**: Track command execution and confirmation requests.
- **Auditing**: Review interactions to maintain security oversight.
- **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to observe command activity in real-time.

## 🧪 Testing

For local testing, use the CLI or API mode as described above to validate the behavior of various commands. API tests can be automated using tools like Postman or curl scripts.

## 🛑 Disclaimer

This tool provides a robust starting point for secure command execution, but it cannot cover every possible risky command. Users are encouraged to contribute suggestions, report issues, and make this tool more comprehensive and adaptable to various use cases.
